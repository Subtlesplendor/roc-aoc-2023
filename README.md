# Advent of Code in Roc 2023 

Usually I only manage a couple of days due to time constraints.

These solutions are written in [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org) ðŸ¤˜, a [fast](https://www.roc-lang.org/fast), [friendly](https://www.roc-lang.org/friendly), and [functional](https://www.roc-lang.org/functional) language.

I am using the [Advent of Code Template](https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/aoc-template).
